QA portfolio: bug reports, test cases, technical analysis for game systems

Hi there! I’m a QA-focused tester with formal QA training, hands-on experience with bug-tracking tools (Jira, TestRail), and foundational programming skills in Python and C++. I understand game architecture at the engine level (Unity / Unreal Engine 4/5) — enough to read logs, trace component interactions, and collaborate efficiently with devs.

My goal is to ensure games work as designed — and help designers understand why some designs are prone to defects. 

##  What’s inside this repo  
| File | Description |
|------|-------------|
| [`bug-reports.md`](bug-reports.md) | (with game names) Realistic bug reports (written after testing indie/demo games) — clear steps, severity assessment, reproducibility focus |
| [`test-cases.md`](test-cases.md) | Structured test cases using equivalence partitioning & boundary analysis (e.g., main menu, save system) |
| [`technical-analysis.md`](technical-analysis.md) | *(coming soon)* — How common bugs emerge from engine-level decisions (e.g., async loading + state corruption) |
| [`scripts/`](scripts/)  | *(coming soon)* Small utilities: log scanner, auto-report generator (Python) |

Note: All reports are based on actual gameplay sessions — no hypotheticals. Screenshots included where relevant.

## Tools & Concepts I Work With  
- Bug Tracking: Jira, TestRail, YouTrack  
- Engines: Unity (scene structure, logs, ScriptableObject flow), Unreal Engine 4/5 (Blueprints overview, common crash patterns)  
- Testing Types: Functional, Regression, Smoke, Compliance Awareness (TRC/XR basics)  
- Tech Stack: Python (automation/helpers), C++ (reading/debugging), Git, Markdown  
- Mindset: Player-first, design-aware, documentation-driven  

I’m actively seeking QA Engineer opportunities (remote or office) — especially in teams where QA contributes early to design and roadmap decisions.
